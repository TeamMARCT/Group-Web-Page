<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Federal agencies shape the regulatory process, affecting countless aspects of our everyday lives. One of the most important parts of the rulemaking process is the ability of the public to participate. At times, federal agencies fail to develop regulations. A petition for rulemaking is the mechanism by which individuals, public interest groups, and private enterprise can argue in favor of changes or new rules for ensuring the general welfare of the nation

Here's why:
* Filing a petition for rulemaking is usually a far more complex and detailed process than commenting on a rule. The Petitionist is here to help with that process!
* Agencies are in no way required to respond to public opinion, but by demonstrating broad support from a large and/or diverse group of people will help strengthen your argument. We're here to create a community to back your petitions!
* It's time to take the means of regulation back to the power of the people! :ledger: :black_nib:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Starting Notes
- Main branch is only for production
- Dev branch is for development. Two person review process for pull requests to the dev and main branch.

### Starting off
- [ ] 1. Clone main repository to local machine
- [ ] 2. git checkout -b [name/feature] -> Create feature branch off main or dev
- [ ] 3. Commit to your local feature branch often!

### Pushing changes to the main repo
- [ ] 1. 'Git checkout dev' (locally switch to dev branch)
- [ ] 2. 'Git pull origin dev' (Pull updates of dev down to your local system)
- [ ] 3. 'Git checkout [your branch] (switch back to your branch locally)
- [ ] 4. 'Git merge dev' (Brings dev into your local branch)
- [ ] 5. Resolve conflicts or :q if there aren't any
- [ ] 6. 'Git push origin <your branch>' (Push merged branch up to github)
- [ ] 7. Create a pull request in github from <your branch> ==> dev
- [ ] 8. Repeat as needed
- [ ] 9. When ready to publish main, do step 7 but from dev => main
  ```
  git checkout dev
  git pull origin dev
  git checkout <name/feature>
  git merge dev
  // Resolve Merge conflicts
  git push origin <name/feature>
  ```
